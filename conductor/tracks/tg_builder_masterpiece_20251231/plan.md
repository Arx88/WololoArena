# Implementation Plan: Battlefield Intelligence Suite (BIS)

This plan focuses on building the "Brain" of the Masterpiece first, then the interface.

## Phase 1: The Inference Engine (The Brain)
Create the core mathematical and logic layers.

- [ ] **Task: Build the "Stacking & Bonus" Multiplier Engine**
  - Implement a system that calculates real stat changes (HP, Attack, Speed) when team bonuses stack.
- [ ] **Task: Develop the "Transition & Obsolescence" Logic**
  - Create an algorithm that evaluates unit counters over time to find the "Point of Strategic Defeat".
- [ ] **Task: Implement "Synchronized Timeline" Generator**
  - Build logic to coordinate 4 separate build orders into one unified team mission.

## Phase 2: Revolutionary UI Modules
Build the specific tools within the suite.

- [ ] **Task: The "Strategic Nexus" Dashboard**
  - Develop a high-fidelity interface showing the "War Table" and tactical decision trees.
- [ ] **Task: Matchup Lab (The Simulator)**
  - Implement the UI where users "clash" their team against meta opponents to see results.
- [ ] **Task: Trade & Economy Visualizer**
  - Create real-time gold-per-minute projections based on the selected team's trade bonuses.

## Phase 3: Final Integration and Professional Polish
Ensure the suite is a "Masterpiece".

- [ ] **Task: Pro-Player Logic Validation**
  - Fine-tune all intelligence advice based on high-level competitive patterns.
- [ ] **Task: Performance and Stability Lockdown**
  - Stress-test the simulation engine to ensure zero crashes and instant reactivity.
- [ ] **Task: Export & Sharing**
  - Allow teams to export their "Tactical Battle Plan" as a high-quality guide.
