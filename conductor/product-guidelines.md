# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Professional and Analytical:** The interface should prioritize clarity, data precision, and ease of use for competitive players.
- **Direct and Functional:** Labels and navigation should be straightforward, minimizing fluff while maintaining a thematic connection to Age of Empires II.

## Visual Identity
- **Dark Mode Centric:** Utilize a high-contrast dark theme (OKLCH-based) to ensure readability during intense gameplay and drafting sessions.
- **Minimalist UI:** Focus on content, statistics, and interactive elements. Avoid unnecessary visual clutter.
- **Thematic Accents:** Incorporate subtle medieval-inspired elements (e.g., gold/primary color accents, stone textures) to align with the Age of Empires II brand.
- **Responsive by Design:** Ensure all features, especially the drafting tool and database, are fully functional and visually coherent on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Interaction & Feedback
- **Non-Intrusive Notifications:** Use toasts (sonner/radix-ui) for brief success or error messages to avoid interrupting the user flow.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Provide immediate visual cues for all user actions, particularly during the time-sensitive drafting phase.

## Technical & Performance Standards
- **Real-time Synchronization:** Maintain low-latency synchronization between players during drafts to ensure a fair and seamless experience.
- **Optimized Performance:** Prioritize fast initial load times and smooth transitions through optimized bundle sizes and efficient data fetching.
- **Offline Capability:** Aim to make core civilization data and statistics available offline for quick reference.

## Localization
- **Community-Driven Multilingualism:** Support multiple languages (starting with English and Spanish) to cater to the diverse global Age of Empires II community.
